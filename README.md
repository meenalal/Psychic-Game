Welcome To Psychic Game

Hello I created this game as a part of an assignment.

The instructions will pop as you open the game in the browser.
How to play: All of you need is to guess the letter from a-z(in lowercase) that computer is thinking of. Sounds easy right?
you will only have 9 tries to guess the correct one and become psychic.
If win or lose, the window alert will pop up to inform you.
Lastly, to restart the game you won't have to reload the page, the new will begin as soon as you are out nine tries.
Good Luck!
